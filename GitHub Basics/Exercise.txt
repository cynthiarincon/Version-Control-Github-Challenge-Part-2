1.EXPLAIN WHAT THE TERMINAL IS IN YOUR OWN WORDS.
- The terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact directly with their computer using commands. 
- It can be used to navigate folders, manage files, and run programs without relying on a graphical interface. 
- While it may seem complicated at first, it is a powerful tool for efficiently managing and controlling a computer.




2. WHAT IS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIT AND GITHUB?
- Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files and allows users to manage different versions of their projects locally on their computer.  
- GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling users to store their projects in the cloud, collaborate with others, and share their work publicly or privately.  
- Essentially, Git manages versions locally, while GitHub provides a collaborative online environment.



3. WHAT ARE THE STEPS TO FORK A GITHUB REPOSITORY?
- First, navigate to the repository you wish to copy on GitHub.  
- Click the “Fork” button in the top-right corner of the page.  
- GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.  
- You can then make changes to your forked repository without affecting the original project.  
- If desired, you can later submit your changes back to the original repository through a pull request.
